### A Quotes writing App where you can add your own quotes. There is a fetched data in this App via Google Firebase. I have created a real-time database in Firebase and stored quotes data in there to have the quotes possible. When a user writes a new quote, it will be directly stored in Google Firebase Database as a real-time database.

#### Please feel free to visit the Demo of the App and write a quote.
